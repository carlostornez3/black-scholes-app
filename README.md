## üìö Theoretical Foundations

### What is an Option?
An option is a contract that gives the **right**, but not the obligation, to buy (**Call**) or sell (**Put**) an underlying asset at a fixed price (Strike Price) on a future date.

### Black-Scholes Model
The Black-Scholes model values European options using:
- **Spot Price (S)**
- **Strike Price (K)**
- **Time to expiration (T)**
- **Volatility (œÉ)**
- **Risk-free rate (r)**

Equations:
\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r + \frac{œÉ^2}{2})T}{œÉ \sqrt{T}}, \quad d_2 = d_1 - œÉ \sqrt{T}
\]
\[
C = S N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
\]
\[
P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S N(-d_1)
\]
