## üìö Theoretical Foundations

### What is an Option?
An option is a contract that gives the **right**, but not the obligation, to buy (**Call**) or sell (**Put**) an underlying asset at a fixed price (Strike Price) on a future date.

### Black-Scholes Model
The Black-Scholes model values European options using:
- **Spot Price (S)**
- **Strike Price (K)**
- **Time to expiration (T)**
- **Volatility (œÉ)**
- **Risk-free rate (r)**

#### Equations:

```math
d_1 = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S}{K}\right) + \left(r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}
```
```math
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
```
```math
C = S \cdot N(d_1) - K \cdot e^{-rT} \cdot N(d_2)
```

```math
P = K \cdot e^{-rT} \cdot N(-d_2) - S \cdot N(-d_1)
```
Where N(‚ãÖ) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF)
